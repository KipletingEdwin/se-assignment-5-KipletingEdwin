9. Debugging in VS Code:
   - Outline the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code. What are some key debugging features available in VS Code?

       ##        Install Required Extensions:
            Ensure you have the necessary extensions installed for debugging the specific programming language or framework you are using (e.g., Debugger for Python for Python debugging).


            Open Your Project:
            Open your project folder or workspace in VS Code (File > Open Folder...).

            Configure Debugging:
            Click on the Run and Debug icon in the Activity Bar on the sidebar (or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Shift + D).

            Create a launch.json Configuration File:
            If a launch.json file does not already exist, VS Code will prompt you to create one.
            Select the environment or framework you want to debug (e.g., Node.js, Python, Java, etc.).

            Set Breakpoints:
            Open the file containing the code you want to debug.
            Click in the gutter next to the line numbers to set breakpoints. Breakpoints pause the execution of your program at specific points to inspect variables and the program's state.

            Start Debugging:
            Press the F5 key or click Start Debugging (green play button) in the Run and Debug view.
            VS Code will start debugging your program and pause at the first breakpoint it encounters.

 ##           Debugging Controls:

            Use the debugging controls in the Run and Debug toolbar:
            Step Over (F10): Executes the current line and moves to the next line in the current file.
            Step Into (F11): Moves into a function call or method.
            Step Out (Shift + F11): Executes the remaining lines of the current function or method and returns to the caller.
            Continue (F5): Resumes program execution until the next breakpoint or the end of the program.
            Restart (Ctrl + Shift + F5): Stops and restarts the debugging session.
            Stop (Shift + F5): Terminates the debugging session.
            Inspect Variables and Call Stack:

            While debugging, you can view the values of variables, inspect the call stack, and evaluate expressions in the Debug Console or Variables pane.


 ##           Key Debugging Features in VS Code:

            Variable Watch: Add variables to watch to monitor their values as you step through the code.

            Conditional Breakpoints: Set breakpoints that only trigger when certain conditions are met, enhancing control over when debugging pauses.

            Debug Console: Execute commands and evaluate expressions interactively during debugging sessions.

            Integrated Terminal: Access the integrated terminal to run debugging commands or interact with your program's environment directly.

            Exception Handling: Configure how VS Code handles exceptions and errors during debugging sessions.

            Multi-Session Debugging: Debug multiple instances or different types of applications simultaneously within VS Code.

            Extension Support: Extensions like Debugger for Chrome or PHP Debug extend VS Code’s debugging capabilities to specific frameworks and tools.

10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.

    ##           Prerequisites:
            Install Git:
            Ensure Git is installed on your computer. You can download and install Git from git-scm.com if it's not already installed.

            GitHub Account:
            Create a GitHub account if you don't already have one. You will need this to push your local repository changes to a remote repository on GitHub.
            Initializing a Git Repository:

            Open Your Project:
            Open your project folder or create a new project folder in VS Code (File > Open Folder...).

            Open Integrated Terminal:
            Press Ctrl + ` (backtick) to open the integrated terminal in VS Code.

            Initialize Git Repository:
            In the integrated terminal, navigate to your project directory if you are not already there.
            Run the following command to initialize a Git repository:

            git init

            This command initializes a new Git repository in your current project directory.
  #          Making Commits:


            Stage Files:

            In VS Code, open the Source Control view from the Activity Bar (or View > Git > Source Control).
            You will see a list of changed files. Click the + button next to each file you want to stage for the commit. Staging prepares files to be included in the next commit.
            Commit Changes:

            Enter a commit message in the Message box at the top of the Source Control view, describing the changes you are committing.
            Click the checkmark icon (✓) or press Ctrl + Enter to commit the changes.
            Pushing Changes to GitHub:
            Create a Repository on GitHub:

            Go to GitHub and create a new repository (if you haven't already).
            Add Remote Repository URL:

            Copy the HTTPS or SSH URL of your GitHub repository.
            In the integrated terminal of VS Code, add the remote repository URL using the following command:
           
            git remote add origin <repository_url>

            Push Changes:

            Push your committed changes to the remote GitHub repository:
  
            git push -u origin master
            
            This command pushes your changes to the master branch of the remote repository (origin). If you are working with a different branch, replace master with the branch name.
            Authentication:

            If prompted, enter your GitHub username and password or authenticate using an SSH key (if you set up SSH authentication).
